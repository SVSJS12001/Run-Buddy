    <!-- hero section -->

        <div class="hero-form">
            <!--One important HTML rule is that both 
            the opening and closing tags of an element must be 
            completely contained inside the parent element. In 
            this case the parent element is <section> and the 
                child element is the <div>. -->
            <h3>Get Started Today</h3>
            <p>Fill out this form and the trainers will schedule a consultation</p>
            <form> <!-- A sign-up form is a call to action, or CTA. Within this 
                <form> will be child elements such as <input> and <label>. <input> 
                elements come in many flavors, such as open-ended (a text field
                that lets the user enter freeform text) and closed-ended 
                (a radio button or checkbox for the user to select or check).
                We'll start by adding the following HTML to the <form> element.
                        
                Look closely at how we pair the <input> and
                corresponding <label> elements and their attributes: -->
                <label for="name">Enter full name:</label>
                <!-- {for} is an attribute in the <label> that programmatically links to 
                the id attribute in the <input> element. The <label> text not only offers 
                a visual directive of what to enter but also programmatically links to the
                associated <input>. When a user with a visual impairment uses a screen reader, 
                the label will be read out when they focus on the input field. Labels also make 
                it easier to fill out forms on mobile devices; clicking on the label will target
                the focus to the associated input field, which can be hard to do manually
                on a small screen. -->
                <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" name="name" id="name" class="form-input">
                <!-- {type} relates to what kind of input element we are using. Here we 
                want a text field, which is also the default value.  
                {Placeholder} offers a hint or label within the text field, but will not 
                be submitted if this field if left blank. 
                {name} identifies the element so the response can be referenced after the 
                form is submitted. -->
                <label for="email">Enter email address:</label>
                <input type="email" placeholder="Email Addesss" name="email" id="email" class="form-input">
                <!--Desktop browsers treat the "tel" input type the same as the default "text" type. 
                    They don't automatically validate the user's inputted value. However, 
                    browsers on mobile devices will display a numeric keypad for the user 
                    to input a value, rather than a standard keyboard. -->
                <label for="phone number">Enter a telphone number:</label>
                <input type="tel" placeholder="Phone Number" name="phone" id="phone" class="form-input">
                <!-- The simbol on the end of the <input> (/>), is known as a self-closing tag 
                    and is a common sight in HTML. Some elements, like <input>, do not 
                    contain any content or child elements, so the closing tag immediately 
                    follows the opening tag. Thus this shortcut was created to self-close 
                    the opening tag. -->
                <p>
                    Have you worked out with a trainer before?
                    <input type="radio" name="trainer-confirm" id="triner-yes" />
                    <label for="triner-yes">Yes</label>
                    <!--This is used to reference which 
                        radio button this label belongs to. The value for the {for} attribute 
                        must match the value of the {id} attribute of the <input> element.-->
                    <input type="radio" name="trainer-confirm" id="triner-no" />
                    <label for="triner-no">No</label>
                </p>
                <!-- We've wrapped both of the answers, including both radio buttons, 
                    in a <p> element that also includes the question. Because the radio 
                    buttons are inline elements, the answer selections will render from 
                    left to right on the same line as our question, just like it does in 
                    the mock-up. Next, the <label> links the displayed values, Yes and No, 
                    to their respective radio inputs. This link enhances accessibility by 
                    allowing users to click on the label's text as well as the radio buttons, 
                    which provides more clickable surface area. 
                    The radio button elements must have the same name attribute in order to be 
                    associated with the same radio group. This is how the browser identifies that 
                    a group of choices can have an exclusive singular answer. In this case, 
                    the value of our radio group in name is trainer-confirm. -->

                    <input type="checkbox" name="age-confirm" id="checkbox" />
                </p>
                <button type="submit" >
                    <!-- A button is an essential component of a user 
                    interface and can have a variety of different functions and uses. 
                    A button can link to another area on the webpage or an external site, 
                    submit data to a server, or be programmed for any activity. n our case, 
                    we need a submit type to perform the needed action. The content of this 
                    element, "Get running", will be written inside the <button> element to 
                    render a label on the button itself.-->

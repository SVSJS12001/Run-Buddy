            <!--One important HTML rule is that both 
the opening and closing tags of an element must be 
completely contained inside the parent element. In 
this case the parent element is <section> and the 
child element is the <div>. -->
            <h3>Get Started Today</h3>
            <p>Fill out this form and the trainers will schedule a consultation</p>
            <form>
                <!-- A sign-up form is a call to action, or CTA. Within this 
<form> will be child elements such as <input> and <label>. <input> 
elements come in many flavors, such as open-ended (a text field
 that lets the user enter freeform text) and closed-ended 
(a radio button or checkbox for the user to select or check).
We'll start by adding the following HTML to the <form> element.
                                        
Look closely at how we pair the <input> and
corresponding <label> elements and their attributes: -->
                <label for="name">Enter full name:</label>
                <!-- {for} is an attribute in the <label> that programmatically links to 
the id attribute in the <input> element. The <label> text not only offers 
a visual directive of what to enter but also programmatically links to the
associated <input>. When a user with a visual impairment uses a screen reader, 
 the label will be read out when they focus on the input field. Labels also make 
 it easier to fill out forms on mobile devices; clicking on the label will target
 the focus to the associated input field, which can be hard to do manually
 on a small screen. -->
                <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" name="name" id="name" class="form-input">
                <!-- {type} relates to what kind of input element we are using. Here we 
want a text field, which is also the default value.  
{Placeholder} offers a hint or label within the text field, but will not 
be submitted if this field if left blank. 
{name} identifies the element so the response can be referenced after the 
 form is submitted. -->
                <label for="email">Enter email address:</label>
                <input type="email" placeholder="Email Addesss" name="email" id="email" class="form-input">
                <!--Desktop browsers treat the "tel" input type the same as the default "text" type. 
They don't automatically validate the user's inputted value. However, 
browsers on mobile devices will display a numeric keypad for the user 
to input a value, rather than a standard keyboard. -->
                <label for="phone number">Enter a telphone number:</label>
                <input type="tel" placeholder="Phone Number" name="phone" id="phone" class="form-input">
                <!-- The simbol on the end of the <input> (/>), is known as a self-closing tag 
and is a common sight in HTML. Some elements, like <input>, do not 
contain any content or child elements, so the closing tag immediately 
follows the opening tag. Thus this shortcut was created to self-close 
the opening tag. -->

                        <!--This is used to reference which 
radio button this label belongs to. The value for the {for} attribute 
must match the value of the {id} attribute of the <input> element.-->

                    <span class="radio-wrapper">

                <!-- We've wrapped both of the answers, including both  
 radio buttons, in a <p> element that also includes the question. Because the radio 
buttons are inline elements, the answer selections will render from  left to right
on the same line as our question, just like it does in the mock-up. Next, the <label>
links the displayed values, Yes and No, to their respective radio inputs. This link 
enhances accessibility by allowing users to click on the label's text as well as the
radio buttons, which provides more clickable surface area. The radio button elements
must have the same name attribute in order to be associated with the same radio group.
This is how the browser identifies that a group of choices can have an exclusive 
singular answer. In this case, the value of our radio group in name is trainer-confirm. -->
